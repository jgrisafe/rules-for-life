# Rules For Life

1. Don’t try to change adults. Accept them or leave them behind.
2. Take personal responsibility for everything. If it happened *to* you, you got there somehow. Learn from it.
3. Have compassionate for everyone. Compassion is not always sympathy, but it is always kind.
4. Be humble.
5. Be generous.
6. Be patient.
7. Be firm with your boundaries.
8. Be honest about your intentions.
9. Do not compromise your values in order to get what you want.
10. Treat yourself like a project. Having compassion for your mistakes with a clear idea on how you wish to be behave the next time around.
11. Love yourself unconditionally. Mistakes are to be learned from, not dwelled on.
12. Stay present. Take it one day at a time. Pausing seldomly and briefly to learn from the past and plan for the future.
13. Enjoy yourself. Have fun. We have no idea how or why we're even here.
14. Avoid name calling, including to yourself.
15. Never use labels or psychiatric diagnoses as weapons.
16. Don’t expect anything from anyone. Nobody owes you anything, if you think they do, go back to number six.
17. Only offer advice when asked for except for a small group of trusted best friends or family members you have complete honesty with and compassion for. You will know who.
18. Inspire, don’t preach.
